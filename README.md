# StackOverflow Clone Server

This is Server side of the StackOverflow Clone project! This server is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Below, you'll find information on how to set up, configure, and run the server.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stackoverflow-clone.git
   cd stackoverflow-clone/server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Project Structure

The server-side code is organized as follows:

- `src`: Contains the source code for the server.
- `models`: Includes Mongoose models for interacting with MongoDB.
- `routes`: Contains Express.js routes for handling different API endpoints.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed.

## Dependencies

The server uses the following dependencies:

- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords securely.
- **bcryptjs**: An optimized bcrypt library.
- **cors**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **dotenv**: Module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **express**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool.
- **nodemon**: Development tool for automatically restarting the server when changes are detected.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and configure the following variables:

```env
PORT=your_server_port
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Running the Server

Start the server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on the specified port, and you can now integrate it with the client-side application.
